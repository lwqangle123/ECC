# ECC
error correcting codes to defense adversarial attacks on GNN
Please download all files especially the deeprobust toolbox;
K_bound is matlab m file for determing the minimum K that satisfies all conditions in paper;
figure is matlab m file containing all codes for reproducing all experimental figures, along with fig_5_a to fig_10_b which are matlab .mat data file for each figure.
two example files are provided to show the defense performance of our ECC method, where we test three attacks (random attack, dice attack, topology attack) on GCN and GAT
